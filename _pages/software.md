# Software

* [pychromVAR](https://github.com/lzj1769/pychromVAR) pychromVAR is a python package for inferring TF variability from scATAC-seq by re-implementing the method proposed in [chromVAR](https://github.com/GreenleafLab/chromVAR).

* [scMEGA](https://costalab.github.io/scMEGA/) scMEGA (Single-cell Multiomic Enhancer-based Gene regulAtory network inference) is a R package designed to infer gene regulatory network by using single cell multi-omics data.

* [scOpen](https://github.com/CostaLab/scopen) scOpen is a method for single-cell open chromatin analysis via NMF modelling.

* [RGT](https://reg-gen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hint/introduction.html) RGT is a Python package for integrative analysis of regulatory genomics data, including HINT-ATAC for prediction of transcription factor binding sites using ATAC-seq, THOR for identification of differential peaks from ChIP-seq, TDF for detection of triple helix mediated RNA and DNA interactions, Motif-analysis for performing operations related to motif analyses visualization, and RGT-viz for finding and visualizing association between distinct regulatory factors.
